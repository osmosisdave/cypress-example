This is a simple cypress project to run against a local website.

The project contains some BDD tests to run against a search function.

The project also contains some BDD tests to run against an applicant workflow, there the applicants moved between states of applied, interviewing and then hired.

There are also commands for running cypress in headless mode within the package json file

and
